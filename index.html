          This website is a walkthrough for how to deploy a static site using
          <a href="https://surge.sh/">Surge</a>. We will walk through all of the
          necessary steps from start to finish, and even cover how you can
          choose a custom domain as well.

        <li><a href="#deploy">Deploy</a> your site with Surge</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>What is a Static Site?</h2>
      <p>
        When we use the term "static", we are referring to the fact that the
        content of the website will not change unless the files are manually
        updated. The site does <em>not</em> interact with a database or involve
        any
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side"
          >server-side processing</a
        >. The site will simply display the same information to every user.
        Typically, static sites are faster and more secure than dynamic sites,
        but offer less functionality for practical use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Surge specializes in deploying and hosting these types of sites, and as
        a result, is extremely light-weight and fast. The feature we love the
        most is that Surge is extremely <em>easy to use</em>.
      </p>

      <h2 id="installing-surge">Installing Surge</h2>
      <p>
        Surge is very easy to install as well. We will perform a global install
        so that you will always have Surge available to deploy your projects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Run the following command from <em>any working directory</em> in your
        terminal:
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="install">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>npm install --global surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        Since it is global, this is an install you will only ever need to run
        <em><b>once</b></em
        >, not on a project-by-project basis.
      </p>

      <h2 id="your-project">Preparing Your Project</h2>
      <p>
        First off, in order for Surge to work, you'll need to be in the same
        directory that your <b>index.html</b> resides. You may need to rearrange
        your files to achieve this. Be aware this may change any relative paths
        in your project. Once that is complete, you are ready to deploy.
      </p>

      <h2 id="deploy">Deployment</h2>
      <p>In the root directory of your project, run the following command:</p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="surge-one">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        You will be prompted to set up an account with Surge in your command
        line. Go ahead and do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next, you'll be asked to confirm the project path. If you are in the
        root directory of your project, this should already be correct. Just
        press <kbd class="shadow">enter</kbd> to continue.
      </p>

      <p>
        You will be automatically assigned a silly (usually) randomly generated
        domain name for your site. This is ok and we can change it later. Press
        <kbd class="shadow">enter</kbd> to continue.
      </p>

      <img src="./images/surge.gif" alt="deploy" class="image gif shadow" />

      <p>
        Once the deployment completes, you can navigate to the assigned domain
        to see your project online!
      </p>

      <h2 id="custom">Setting Up a Custom Domain (optional)</h2>
      <p>
        We can set up a file in your project that will remember the particular
        domain you want to use. This step is entirely optional.
      </p>

      <h3>Choose a Domain</h3>
      <p>
        First, we'll need to see that the URL you want to use is available. Open
        a browser window and navigate to any surge domain you'd like.
      </p>

      <p>The URL should follow this format:</p>

      <div class="browser shadow">
        <code> https://staticdeployment.surge.sh/ </code>
      </div>

      <p>If it's available, the URL should show this in the browser:</p>

      <img src="./images/not-found.png" alt="not-found" class="image shadow" />

      <p>
        This means that no one else has deployed a project to this URL, and that
        it is available to be used. Remember this URL for the next step.
      </p>

      <h3>Setting Up a CNAME File</h3>
      <p>
        Next, we will create a special file that we can store our chosen domain
        in.
      </p>

      <p>In the root directory of your project, run this command:</p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="cname">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>touch CNAME</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        This will create the CNAME file. Go ahead and open it in VSCode. Place
        your chosen domain into this file on the top line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Surge will automatically recognize that there is a CNAME file and go
        there to fetch your domain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Save the file and run the <b>surge</b> command once again to re-deploy.
      </p>

      <div class="shell shadow" id="surge-two">
        <div class="code">
          <p>$</p>
          <code>surge</code>
        </div>
        <div class="copy">
          <img src="./images/copy.png" alt="copy" />
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>Now, navigate to your chosen domain to see your project there!</p>
      <h2>Recap</h2>
      <p>
        In this walkthrough, we learned how to use the simplest deployment tool
        available - Surge. We also learned how to set up a custom domain with
        Surge by utilizing a CNAME file.
